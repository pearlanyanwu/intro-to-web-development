# Intro to Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL)

### Spring 2022 - San Francisco State University

For my term project, I created a semi-functional website that, if it were real, would offer birthstones as accessories.

The functions of this website are the following:
1.  Create a new account.
2.  Log in to and log out from an exisiting account.)
3.  Search for a product using the search bar. (Products are searched for and grouped together by at least one character.)
4.  Upload an image of their own. (User must be logged in to do this.)
5.  Comment on a post. (User must be logged in to do this.)
6.  Non-registered users can search for a product without having an exisiting account or being logged in.

* Note: The size of this file is too large to be displayed in the desired format. If you would like to watch this 10-minute demo, you may need to click "View raw", allow the file to download onto your device and then double-click it from your downloads folder.
